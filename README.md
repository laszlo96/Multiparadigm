**TranslateBouncing**

This application is translating text from a given language to random languages (from a list of 6 languages: turkish, spanish, english, hungarian, german, italian) a set amount of times, with using IBM's Watson cloud service.
At the end, the application translate it back to the original language.

My goal with this project is to complete the Multiparadigm programming languages class in the Eszterházy Károly University.

There is some instruction to use this application:
- Put your apikey and serviceUrl to the right part of source.json (you can get apikey and serviceUrl from IBM's Watson Cloud Service (free registration))
- If you want to change source language from Turkish, you have to pick the right format of your choosen language (ISO 639-1)
